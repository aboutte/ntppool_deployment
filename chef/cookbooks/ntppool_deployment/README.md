# cms-rean-cookbook

The cms-rean cookbook was created to facilitate the configuration of a CMS deployment.  Currently the installation of WordPress is supported.
cms-rean has several [dependencies](https://github.com/andyboutte/cms-deployment/blob/master/chef/cookbooks/cms-rean/Berksfile) that it relies on to do the heavy lifting.

## Supported Platforms

Tested on Amazon Linux

## Attributes

### Wrapper Attributes

Several WordPress cookbook attributes are overridden in cms-rean.  See the [WordPress](https://github.com/brint/wordpress-cookbook) cookbook README for details.

## Usage

### cms-rean::default

- sets hostname
- installs some additional packages that would be useful for troubleshooting
- depending on `node['cloud']['application']` include the wordpress or drupal recipe (drupal not currently implemented)

### cms-rean::wordpress

This recipe includes the WordPress cookbook that does all the heavy lifting.  The WordPress cookbook provides the following:

- installs php
- install httpd
- lays down a virtual host file for WordPress
- install MySql
- configures MySQL root password and WordPress specific user

The last thing cms-rean::wordpress does is complete the initial WordPress site setup using the wp-cli


### cms-rean::users

Adds all sysadmin users from databags and allows sysadmin group root access
